Badger Buzz
===========

Badger Buzz is a Windows 8 Metro app that received first place at [a Microsoft hackathon](https://www.facebook.com/events/466162720130325/) at the University of Wisconsin - Madison on April 27, 2013.

## Motivation
As a college student, surely you want to stay connected to your school and be ever mindful of everything that's happening on campus. The good news is that everything you need to know is now available on the internet. Unfortunately, however, the information you need is spread across many different websites which you must check individually: university websites, event calendars, campus newspapers, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and the list goes on. Wouldn't it be nice to have a "one-stop shop" for all of this information? Meet Badger Buzz!

## Badger Buzz
Badger Buzz is a central information hub built specifically for students at the University of Wisconsin. Stay informed with the latest news from [news.wisc.edu](http://news.wisc.edu), see [@UWMadison](http://twitter.com/UWMadison)'s latest Twitter activity, and keep up-to-date with the latest campus events from [today.wisc.edu](http://today.wisc.edu). No more jumping from site to site to get the information you need!

## Disclaimer
What you see in this repository is the end product from the 11-hour hackathon. No further work has been done, nor do I plan to work on it further at this point. That being said, the app is obviously not complete and needs some serious work before it could be released to anyone for actual use. Since it was literally hacked together in a matter of hours, there are aspects which I had to neglect, namely the UI. During the hackathon, I decided to focus on content and functionality rather than prettiness. Just a heads up!
